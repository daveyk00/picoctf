#### Description

Can you look at the data in this binary: [static](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0f6ea599582dcce7b4f1ba94e3617baf/static)? This [BASH script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0f6ea599582dcce7b4f1ba94e3617baf/ltdis.sh) might help!

#### Solution

We can run `strings static` and see the flag, however lets look at the bash script
```bash
#!/bin/bash



echo "Attempting disassembly of $1 ..."


#This usage of "objdump" disassembles all (-D) of the first file given by 
#invoker, but only prints out the ".text" section (-j .text) (only section
#that matters in almost any compiled program...

objdump -Dj .text $1 > $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt


#Check that $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt is non-empty
#Continue if it is, otherwise print error and eject

if [ -s "$1.ltdis.x86_64.txt" ]
then
	echo "Disassembly successful! Available at: $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt"

	echo "Ripping strings from binary with file offsets..."
	strings -a -t x $1 > $1.ltdis.strings.txt
	echo "Any strings found in $1 have been written to $1.ltdis.strings.txt with file offset"



else
	echo "Disassembly failed!"
	echo "Usage: ltdis.sh <program-file>"
	echo "Bye!"
fi
```

Running `ltdis.sh static` and then looking at the contents of `static.ltdis.strings.txt` we can see the flag
